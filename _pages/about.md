I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at UC Berkeley. My research is advised by Alyosha Efros, Angjoo Kanazawa, and Jitendra Malik, within the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) lab, as well as Charan Ranganath and Randy O'Reilly, within UC Davis' Center for Neuroscience. Generally, my work seeks to understand neural function within a 'biologilogically plausible optimization framework,' integrating traditional neuroscientific approaches and deep learning computational methods.  

In 2023, I completed my PhD in Computational Cognitive Neuroscience at Stanford, where I was advised by Dr. Anthony Wagner and Dan Yamins. Using deep learning computational methods, my work sought to formalize and evaluate theories of medial temporal lobe (MTL) involvement in visual object perception. Prior to graduate school I conducted neuroscientific research in the department of Brain and Cognitive Science (BCS) at MIT, working with Rebecca Saxe, as wel as the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, with Daniel Margulies.
