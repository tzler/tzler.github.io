I'm a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at UC Berkeley. My work integrates traditional neuroscientific approaches and deep learning computational methods. Within the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) lab I'm advised by [Alyosha Efros](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/efros.html), [Angjoo Kanazawa](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/), and [Jitendra Malik](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/malik.html). This work is co-advised by [Charan Ranganath](https://neuroscience.ucdavis.edu/people/charan-ranganath) and [Randy O'Reilly](https://neuroengineering.ucdavis.edu/people/randall-oreilly), within UC Davis' Center for Neuroscience.

I completed my PhD in 2023 at Stanford University, where I was mentored by [Anthony Wagner](https://profiles.stanford.edu/anthony-wagner) and [Dan Yamins](https://profiles.stanford.edu/daniel-yamins). My work sought to formalize and evaluate theories of medial temporal lobe (MTL) involvement in perception using a combination of neural, behavioral, and computational approaches. Prior to graduate school I conducted neuroscientific research in the department of Brain and Cognitive Science (BCS) at MIT, as well as the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany.

## funding

My scientific research began with the support of the NSF's Tools for Success program, while I was a student at Miami Dade Community College. My PhD was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP), alongside several Stanford programs, including Diversifying Academia Recruiting Excellence (DARE), Mind Brain Computational and Technology (MBCT), and NeuroCircles. In addition to the UC Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, my postdoctoral research is supported by the NIH's F99/K00 Diversity Specialized Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Advancement in Neuroscience (D-SPAN) Award.
